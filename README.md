# TODO List

- Make website more responsive/dynamic -- (e.g. decrease width of browser, text should break)
- Improve mobile experience
- Newsletter 
- Gallery of the store
- Find movies from the same collection from the movie modal page or something
- Add link to trailer or embedded youtube player
- standardize naming conventions, and remove reference of "movie" since inclusion of television -- "media"? -- possibly include video games at some point
- not sure correct language to use, but use history (URL bar) to make more user friendly (use case: request rental then go back, should put you back in modal with your filters)
- standardize styling
- email verification/general form verification
- Accounts
    - "Seen"
    - my list
    - favourites
- ~~Separate Movies and Television? or just make genre tag "television"~~
- ~~Make gradient for staff pick and new release carousel~~
- ~~use star ratings~~
- ~~Improve search (e.g. search "mission impossible")~~ might need more testing
- ~~Improve Movie Modal, more like Netflix~~
- ~~Improve display page - just show the posters? Netflix type display that shows genres with scroll left/right buttons. Large banner with staff recommendations or something~~
- ~~maybe add a staff pick banner - or some way to display staff picks~~
- ~~mobile~~
- ~~improve pagination - jump to pages, jump to end and beginning, copy letterboxd~~ 
- ~~make font cooler~~


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
